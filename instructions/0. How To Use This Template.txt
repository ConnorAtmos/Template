1. Git Clone this repository (project_name is the name of the project you want to create):
    git clone !<project_link> <project_name>

2. CD into the project directory and remove the git repository:
    cd <project_name> && rm -rf .git

3. Run structure_builder.py for next steps:
    python3 structure_builder.py

You should then modify info.py. This file contains all the information about your project.
