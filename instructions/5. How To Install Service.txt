A service is a program that runs in the background. This is useful for running a program that you want to run all the time, such as a web server.

1. Run the following command to move the service file to the correct directory:
    sudo mv [service_path] [service_moved_path]

    sudo mv !<service_path> !<service_moved_path>

2. Reload the daemon:
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

3. Run the following command to enable the service:
    sudo systemctl enable [service_name]

    sudo systemctl enable !<service_name>

4. Start the service:
    sudo systemctl restart [service_name]

    sudo systemctl restart !<service_name>

5. View status of service:
    sudo systemctl status [service_name]

    sudo systemctl status !<service_name>

To stop the service, run:
    sudo systemctl stop [service_name]

    sudo systemctl stop !<service_name>

To disable the service, run:
    sudo systemctl disable [service_name

    sudo systemctl disable !<service_name>
